_Typesafe & reactive Kafka Subjects made with Typescript, KafkaJS and RxJS._

## Quickstart

```sh
npm i ts-reactivekafka
```

```typescript
import rxkafka from "ts-reactivekafka";
import { tap } from "rxjs/operators";

(async () => {
	let kafkaConfig = {
		kafkaHost: process.env.KAFKA_HOST || "url:9092",
		serviceId: "test",
		logAllEvents: true,
		ssl: true,
		sasl: {
			mechanism: "plain",
			username: process.env.KAFKA_USER || "xxuser",
			password: process.env.KAFKA_PASS || "xxapitoken",
		},
	};

	let kafka = rxkafka({
		...kafkaConfig,
		consumerConfig: {
			topics: ["topicA", "topicB", "topicC"],
			consumerId: "testConsumer",
		},
		producerConfig: {
			topics: ["target"],
		},
	});

	kafka.consumer
		.getSubject()
		.pipe(
			tap((event) => console.log(event)) // rxjs operators
		)
		.subscribe(kafka.producer.getSubject());
})();
```

## Singleton Pattern

The code follows a Singleton Pattern in which an optional consumer and producer instance are made available given the respective consumer and producer configurations and given a general Kafka config. The only public method for both instances is _getSubject()_ which returns the RxJs Subject (a multicasted observable). The subjects are typed as follows:

```typescript
type Event = {
	key?: string | null
	value: any
	partition?: number
	headers?: IHeaders
	timestamp?: string
}

Subject<{topic: string, message: Event}>
```

Since, in Typescript, no basic JSON type exists _yet_ the value is typed as any. It is important however that the value of the Kafka messages are JSON strings (are JSON parseable).

## Reactive Operators

RxJs offers a vast range operators in which developers can construct fast & flexible functionally reactive programming constructs.
A good overview of the operators can be found here:

## Optimized module thanks to Vercel Ncc

[Vercel's ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) provides NPM developers with the ultimate NPM module compilation toolkit:

- Publish minimal packages to npm
- Only ship relevant app code to serverless environments
- Don't waste time configuring bundlers
- Generally faster bootup time and less I/O overhead
- Compiled language-like experience (e.g.: go)
